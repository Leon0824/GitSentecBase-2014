base-2014
=========

The base 2014 theme. Built with Foundation 5 and Sass.

To install manually, go to `theme/` and do a checkout:

Set `theme: base-2014` in your `config.yml`, and you're good to go! 

If you wish to use sass with your theme, be sure to checkout the 'Foundation' submodule, and start your favorite sass parser, for example 'compass'

  git submodule init; git submodule update
  compass watch
