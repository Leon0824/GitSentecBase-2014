base-2014
=========

This is thee base 2014 theme for Bolt. Built with Foundation 5 and Sass.

To install manually, go to `theme/` and do a checkout: 

  git clone https://github.com/bolt/base-2014.git

Set `theme: base-2014` in your `config.yml`, and you're good to go! 

If you wish to use sass with your theme, be sure to checkout the 'Foundation'
submodule, and start your favorite sass parser, for example 'grunt':

```
bower install
npm install
grunt watch
```
  
If you need some pointers to get started with node, grunt and bower in
combination with Foundation, I recommend these links:
